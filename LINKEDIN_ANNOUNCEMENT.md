# LinkedIn Announcement - Windsurf Privacy Toolkit

## ðŸ“± LinkedIn Post

ðŸš¨ **New Open Source Release: Windsurf Privacy Enforcer & Historical Access Clear** ðŸš¨

After conducting extensive security research on Windsurf IDE, I'm releasing a complete privacy protection toolkit to help the community take control of their data.

**What I Found:**
â€¢ 178 MB of data transmitted during normal usage
â€¢ 16+ directories tracked OUTSIDE the opened workspace
â€¢ 110 active network connections including Google Cloud
â€¢ Complete file contents transmitted via Protocol Buffers
â€¢ Persistent tracking IDs enabling cross-session profiling

**The Problem:**
Security researchers, bug bounty hunters, and privacy-conscious developers need tools to audit and control what AI-powered IDEs are doing with their code and research.

**The Solution:**
I've built a complete toolkit with 4 security scripts + macOS desktop app:

âœ… **audit_windsurf_access.sh** - 10-point security assessment
âœ… **clear_windsurf_tracking.sh** - Remove 153MB of tracking data
âœ… **sandbox_windsurf.sh** - Restrict excessive permissions
âœ… **verify_cleanup.sh** - Monitor and verify effectiveness

**Why This Matters:**
If you're working on vulnerability research, 0-day exploits, or any sensitive security work, you need visibility into what your development tools are transmitting. This toolkit gives you that control.

**Open Source & Free:**

MIT Licensed. Contributions welcome. Built for the security community.

**For Security Researchers:**
Use this before opening sensitive projects. Combine with network monitoring tools. Consider isolated VMs for critical work.

**Tested on:** macOS 14+ (Sonoma, Sequoia)
**Coming soon:** Linux/Windows support

Transparency in AI tools isn't optionalâ€”it's essential. Let's build tools that respect user privacy while enabling powerful AI assistance.

## ðŸ“Š Alternative Shorter Version (Character-Conscious)

ðŸš¨ **Releasing: Windsurf Privacy Enforcer Toolkit** ðŸš¨

Security research revealed Windsurf IDE tracking 16+ directories outside your workspace and transmitting 178 MB of data including complete file contents.

I built an open-source toolkit to fix this:

âœ… Verify effectiveness

Perfect for security researchers, bug bounty hunters, and privacy-conscious devs.
