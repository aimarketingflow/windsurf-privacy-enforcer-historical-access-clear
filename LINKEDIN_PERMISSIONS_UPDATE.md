# LinkedIn Post - Windsurf Privacy Toolkit: Complete Permission Control

## 🔒 Major Update: Full Control Over Windsurf's Permissions & Access

I'm excited to share a massive update to the Windsurf Privacy Toolkit! This week, we've added comprehensive permission monitoring, folder access management, AND the ability to reset/sandbox Windsurf.

### 🎯 What's New:

**5 New Tabs for Complete Control:**

🔒 **Permissions Tab**
- View macOS system permissions (Camera, Microphone, Full Disk Access)
- Check Bluetooth and AppleScript access
- Monitor network permissions
- Real-time permission scanning

🌍 **Global Access Tab**
- Analyze which system folders Windsurf has accessed
- See if sensitive locations (Desktop, Downloads, Library) are exposed
- Security assessment: Excellent → High Risk
- 🔒 **Lock to Documents Only** button (one-click restriction)
- 📋 **Change Log** with timestamps of all access modifications
- Expandable folder lists

📁 **Folder Access Tab**
- Sortable table of all tracked folders
- Color-coded status: ✅ Read/Write, ❌ Not Found
- Export workspace chats to local _Chatlogs (MD, JSON, CSV)
- Remove individual folder access
- Clean up stale "Not Found" entries with one click

🧪 **Sandbox Tab** (NEW!)
- 🔄 Reset ALL TCC permissions (force re-request)
- 📁 Clear all folder access tracking
- 🧪 Launch Windsurf in sandboxed mode
- 🔥 Nuclear option: Reset everything
- Perfect for testing and debugging permissions

🖥️ **Desktop Launcher**
- Auto-finds toolkit even if you move the folder
- One-click launch from Desktop
- Smart permission checking

### 💡 Why This Matters:

After using Windsurf's cleanup features, many users wondered: "What does Windsurf still have access to?" 

Now you can:
✅ See exactly which folders are tracked
✅ Identify if sensitive system locations are exposed
✅ Lock Windsurf to Documents only (one click!)
✅ Track when permissions change with timestamped logs
✅ Reset ALL permissions to force re-requests
✅ Export chat history before removing access
✅ Clean up stale tracking entries
✅ Sandbox Windsurf for testing
✅ Make informed decisions about privacy

### 🎨 UI Improvements:
- 25% wider window for better visibility
- Visual tab separators for organization
- Sortable, color-coded tables
- Click to expand folder lists
- Real-time security assessments
- Desktop app launcher that auto-finds toolkit

### 📊 Real-World Impact:

In my testing, I discovered Windsurf was tracking 24 folders across my system. After using the toolkit:
- Removed 10 "Not Found" stale entries
- 🔒 Locked access to Documents folder only (one click!)
- 📋 All changes logged with timestamps
- Security assessment: ✅ EXCELLENT
- Exported all chat histories for future reference
- Can reset permissions anytime for testing

### 🚀 Try It Yourself:

The toolkit is open-source and available on GitHub. Whether you're concerned about privacy, want to understand what your AI tools access, or just like having control over your data - this update gives you complete visibility.

**Key Features:**
