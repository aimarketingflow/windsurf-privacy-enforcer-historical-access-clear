# LinkedIn Post - Windsurf Privacy Toolkit: Permissions & Folder Access Update

## 🔒 Major Update: Complete Visibility into Windsurf's System Access

I'm excited to share another significant update to the Windsurf Privacy Toolkit! This week, we've added comprehensive permission and folder access monitoring.

### 🎯 What's New:

**3 New Tabs for Complete Visibility:**

🔒 **Permissions Tab**
- View macOS system permissions (Camera, Microphone, Full Disk Access)
- Check Bluetooth and AppleScript access
- Monitor network permissions
- Real-time permission scanning

🌍 **Global Access Tab**
- Analyze which system folders Windsurf has accessed
- See if sensitive locations (Desktop, Downloads, Library) are exposed
- Security assessment: Excellent → High Risk
- One-click removal of entire location access
- Expandable folder lists

📁 **Folder Access Tab**
- Sortable table of all tracked folders
- Color-coded status: ✅ Read/Write, ❌ Not Found
- Export workspace chats to local _Chatlogs (MD, JSON, CSV)
- Remove individual folder access
- Clean up stale "Not Found" entries with one click

### 💡 Why This Matters:

After using Windsurf's cleanup features, many users wondered: "What does Windsurf still have access to?" 

Now you can:
✅ See exactly which folders are tracked
✅ Identify if sensitive system locations are exposed
✅ Export chat history before removing access
✅ Clean up stale tracking entries
✅ Make informed decisions about privacy

### 🎨 UI Improvements:
- 25% wider window for better visibility
- Visual tab separators for organization
- Sortable, color-coded tables
- Click to expand folder lists
- Real-time security assessments

### 📊 Real-World Impact:

In my testing, I discovered Windsurf was tracking 24 folders across my system. After cleanup:
- Removed 10 "Not Found" stale entries
- Limited access to Documents folder only
- Security assessment: ✅ EXCELLENT
- Exported all chat histories for future reference

### 🚀 Try It Yourself:

The toolkit is open-source and available on GitHub. Whether you're concerned about privacy, want to understand what your AI tools access, or just like having control over your data - this update gives you complete visibility.

**Key Features:**
- No data collection
- Runs locally on your Mac
- Preserves chat history when removing access
- One-click cleanup of stale entries
- Security-first design
