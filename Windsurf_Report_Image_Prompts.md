## IMAGE 1: Data Flow Architecture Diagram
**Title:** "Every Keystroke to Google Cloud: The Hidden Data Pipeline"

### Prompt:
```
Create a detailed technical diagram showing data flow from a developer's keyboard through Windsurf IDE to Google Cloud Platform. Use a dark tech aesthetic with glowing connection lines.

Visual elements:
- LEFT: Developer at laptop typing code, with small data packets emanating from keyboard
- CENTER: Windsurf IDE logo/icon with "language_server_macos_arm" process label showing "1.6 GB RAM"
- Multiple glowing purple data streams flowing right, labeled:
  * "Every keystroke" (thin continuous stream)
  * "Workspace index" (thick burst)
  * "File paths" (medium stream)
  * "Code snippets" (medium stream)
- RIGHT: Google Cloud Platform logo with server racks
- BELOW GCP: Three destinations branching out:
  * "AI Model Inference" (purple glow)
  * "BigQuery Analytics DB" (orange glow)
  * "Third-party AI Providers" (red glow)
- OVERLAY: Transparent stats boxes showing:
  * "93 MB in 43 minutes"
  * "146,886 packets"
  * "56 packets/second"

Color scheme: Dark background (#1a1a1a), purple data streams (#667eea), red warning elements (#f44336), orange accents (#ff9800)

Style: Isometric 3D technical diagram, clean lines, professional infographic style, similar to cloud architecture diagrams

## IMAGE 2: Privacy Overreach Comparison
**Title:** "What Users Expect vs. What Actually Happens"

### Prompt:
```
Create a split-screen comparison illustration showing the gap between user expectations and reality in Windsurf IDE data collection.

LEFT SIDE - "What Users Expect" (Green/Safe):
- Small, contained workspace showing single file icon
- Minimal data stream (thin line) going to cloud only when user clicks "Ask AI" button
- Label: "Send only the code I select when I ask for help"
- Visual: Clean, organized, user in control
- Color: Green tones (#4caf50), minimal connections

RIGHT SIDE - "What Actually Happens" (Red/Danger):
- Entire folder tree with hundreds of file icons sprawling outward
- Massive data streams (thick glowing lines) continuously flowing to cloud
- Multiple connections labeled:
  * "Every keystroke"
  * "All open files"
  * "Workspace structure"
  * "Git repository info"
  * "Edit history"
- Label: "Continuous scanning of entire workspace, transmitted on every keystroke"
- Visual: Chaotic, overwhelming, surveillance-like
- Color: Red tones (#f44336), excessive connections

CENTER: Large "VS" separator with scale showing "100x MORE DATA"

Style: Modern flat design with subtle shadows, infographic style, clear visual contrast between left and right

## IMAGE 3: The Irony Visualization
**Title:** "Investigating Google While Sending Evidence to Google"

### Prompt:
```
Create a dramatic circular irony illustration showing the conflict of interest in investigating Google while using Google Cloud infrastructure.

Center: Security researcher at desk with laptop, surrounded by evidence documents floating around them:
- "GOOGLE_EVIDENCE_PACKAGE.md"
- "GMAIL_ATTACK_REPORT.md"
- "768 KB Gmail Exfiltration"
- "Carrier-Level Attack Timeline"

These documents have glowing data streams flowing OUT from the laptop, forming a circular path that leads to:

Top Right: Large Google Cloud Platform logo with server infrastructure

The data streams loop back around with labels:
- "File paths transmitted"
- "Code snippets sent"
- "Evidence metadata shared"
- "Investigation targets revealed"

Bottom: Large text overlay: "THE IRONY: Documenting Google's security failures... on Google's servers"

Visual metaphor: The researcher is unknowingly feeding evidence to the subject of investigation, shown by the circular data flow creating an ouroboros (snake eating its tail) effect

Color scheme: Dark background, purple/blue data streams turning red as they approach Google Cloud, orange warning highlights

Style: Conceptual illustration, slightly surreal to emphasize the irony, professional but with dramatic lighting

## IMAGE 4: Workspace Scanning Heatmap
**Title:** "88,729 Loopback Packets: The Hidden Workspace Surveillance"

### Prompt:
```
Create a technical heatmap visualization showing Windsurf's continuous workspace scanning activity over 43 minutes.

Main visual: Top-down view of a file system tree/folder structure with heat signatures:
- ROOT: "AIMFGuideforCybersec" folder at center
- Branching folders:
  * LinkedInExploit/ (BRIGHT RED - heavily scanned)
  * WindsurfExploit-Oct25/ (BRIGHT RED)
  * Spotify_Attack_Data/ (ORANGE)
  * Various other folders (YELLOW to GREEN)

Animated-style scan lines sweeping across the folders repeatedly

Left side panel showing real-time stats:
- "Loopback Packets: 88,729"
- "Memory Usage: 1.6 GB"
- "Duration: 43 minutes"
- "Files Indexed: 500+"

Bottom: Timeline showing packet bursts:
- X-axis: Time (17:06 - 17:50)
- Y-axis: Packet count
- Visualization: Continuous high activity (never stops)

Overlay text: "CONTINUOUS SCANNING - Even when you're not typing"

Color scheme: Heat map colors (green → yellow → orange → red), dark background, purple accents for UI elements

Style: Technical monitoring dashboard, similar to network traffic analysis tools, professional cybersecurity aesthetic
