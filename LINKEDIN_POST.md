## 🔒 Introducing Windsurf Privacy Toolkit v2.1 - Your AI IDE Privacy Guardian

I'm excited to share a major update to my open-source privacy toolkit for Windsurf AI IDE! 🚀

**The Problem:**
Modern AI IDEs like Windsurf collect extensive tracking data - workspace associations, file paths, machine IDs, and historical access records. While these tools are powerful for development, they can compromise privacy by maintaining persistent tracking across sessions.

**The Solution:**
Windsurf Privacy Toolkit - a comprehensive privacy management system with both GUI and terminal interfaces.

## 🤔 Why This Matters:

As AI-powered development tools become ubiquitous, understanding and controlling what data they collect is crucial. This toolkit empowers developers to:

- **Maintain privacy** without sacrificing productivity
- **Understand** what data is being tracked
- **Control** when and how tracking occurs
- **Preserve** development environments efficiently

Privacy shouldn't be an afterthought in AI-assisted development. It should be a fundamental right.
