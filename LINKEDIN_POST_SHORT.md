🔒 **Windsurf Privacy Toolkit v2.1 Update - You Asked, I Built It!**

Remember my Windsurf privacy toolkit? The response was incredible - and your feedback shaped this massive v2.1 update! 🚀 

**The Challenge:**
AI IDEs are powerful, but they collect extensive tracking data - workspace paths, machine IDs, file history. This can compromise privacy across development sessions.

**The Solution:**
A comprehensive toolkit with GUI + terminal interfaces to audit, clean, and monitor AI IDE tracking.
