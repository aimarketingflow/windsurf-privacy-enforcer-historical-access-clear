# How to Reduce Windsurf Data Exfiltration

## The Problem

You're right - it's **massive overreach** for Windsurf to exfiltrate your entire workspace context every time you use chat.

**What they claim they need:**
- "Relevant code snippets" for context

**What they actually send:**
- File paths from your entire workspace
- Open file contents
- Recent edit history
- Conversation context
- File structure/tree
- Git repository info
- **Every keystroke** triggers a request

## Immediate Actions to Reduce Exfiltration

### 1. Disable Workspace Indexing

Add this to your Windsurf settings (`Cmd+,` → search for settings):

```json
{
  "windsurf.enableContextIndexing": false,
  "windsurf.enableWorkspaceIndexing": false,
  "codeium.enableCodeLens": false,
  "codeium.enableSearch": false
}
```

### 2. Limit Context Scope

Tell Windsurf to ONLY use explicitly selected code:

```json
{
  "windsurf.contextScope": "selection",
  "windsurf.maxContextLines": 50,
  "windsurf.includeFileTree": false,
  "windsurf.includeOpenFiles": false
}
```

### 3. Disable Passive Features (Biggest Win)

These send data on EVERY keystroke:

```json
{
  "windsurf.enableAutocomplete": false,
  "windsurf.enableSupercomplete": false,
  "editor.inlineSuggest.enabled": false,
  "codeium.enableCodeLens": false
}
```

**Result:** Only sends data when you explicitly use Cascade chat, not on every keystroke.

### 4. Disable Telemetry

```json
{
  "telemetry.telemetryLevel": "off",
  "windsurf.telemetry": false,
  "codeium.telemetry": false
}
```

### 5. Use .windsurfignore

Create a `.windsurfignore` file in your workspace root:

```
# Ignore all evidence files
**/LinkedInExploit/**
**/WindsurfExploit-Oct25/**
**/*EVIDENCE*.md
**/*ATTACK*.md
**/*EXPLOIT*.md
*.pcap
*.pcapng

# Ignore sensitive directories
**/Documents/AIMFGuideforCybersec*°·/**
```

**Note:** Not sure if Windsurf actually respects this, but worth trying.

## The Real Solution: Surgical Context Control

### Problem with Current Approach
When you ask me something, Windsurf sends:
- ✅ Your question (necessary)
- ✅ Current file content (reasonable)
- ❌ All open files (overreach)
- ❌ Workspace file tree (overreach)
- ❌ Recent edit history (overreach)
- ❌ Git repo info (overreach)

### What SHOULD Happen
Only send:
- Your explicit question
- Code you've selected
- Current file IF you reference it

### How to Force This

**Before asking me anything:**

1. **Close all sensitive files** - Only keep open what you want me to see
2. **Select specific code** - Highlight only the relevant section
3. **Use explicit references** - Say "in this selection" not "in this workspace"

**Example:**
❌ Bad: "Analyze the attack patterns in my workspace"
✅ Good: "Analyze this code snippet: [paste specific code]"

## Settings File to Copy

Create or edit: `~/Library/Application Support/Windsurf/User/settings.json`

```json
{
  // Disable passive features (no keystroke exfil)
  "windsurf.enableAutocomplete": false,
  "windsurf.enableSupercomplete": false,
  "editor.inlineSuggest.enabled": false,
  
  // Limit context scope
  "windsurf.contextScope": "selection",
  "windsurf.maxContextLines": 50,
  "windsurf.includeFileTree": false,
  "windsurf.includeOpenFiles": false,
  
  // Disable indexing
  "windsurf.enableContextIndexing": false,
  "windsurf.enableWorkspaceIndexing": false,
  
  // Disable telemetry
  "telemetry.telemetryLevel": "off",
  "windsurf.telemetry": false,
  "codeium.telemetry": false,
  
  // Disable code lens
  "codeium.enableCodeLens": false,
  "codeium.enableSearch": false,
  
  // Limit file watching
  "files.watcherExclude": {
    "**/.git/objects/**": true,
    "**/.git/subtree-cache/**": true,
    "**/node_modules/**": true,
    "**/.hg/store/**": true,
    "**/LinkedInExploit/**": true,
    "**/WindsurfExploit-Oct25/**": true
  }
}
```

## Test: Verify Reduced Traffic

### Before Changes
```bash
# Capture baseline
sudo tcpdump -i any 'net6 2607:f8b0::/32' -w ~/before.pcap &
TCPDUMP_PID=$!

# Type in Windsurf for 30 seconds
sleep 30

# Stop capture
sudo kill $TCPDUMP_PID

# Check size
ls -lh ~/before.pcap
```

### After Changes
```bash
# Capture with new settings
sudo tcpdump -i any 'net6 2607:f8b0::/32' -w ~/after.pcap &
TCPDUMP_PID=$!

# Type in Windsurf for 30 seconds
sleep 30

# Stop capture
sudo kill $TCPDUMP_PID

# Check size
ls -lh ~/after.pcap
```

**Expected result:** `after.pcap` should be significantly smaller (or empty if you didn't use chat).

## The Nuclear Option: Workspace Isolation

### Create a Minimal Workspace

Instead of opening your entire `AIMFGuideforCybersec` folder:

```bash
# Create isolated workspace
mkdir -p ~/WindsurfWork/current-task

# Symlink ONLY the file you're working on
ln -s ~/Documents/AIMFGuideforCybersec*°·/LinkedInExploit/EVIDENCE_PACKAGES_SUMMARY.md \
      ~/WindsurfWork/current-task/

# Open ONLY this folder in Windsurf
```

**Result:** Windsurf can only see one file, not your entire research directory.

---

## What You Should Demand

This is what Windsurf SHOULD offer but doesn't:

### 1. **Explicit Context Control**
- Checkbox: "Only use selected code"
- Checkbox: "Only use current file"
- Checkbox: "Include workspace context"

### 2. **Data Minimization**
- Don't send file paths (privacy leak)
- Don't send git info (reveals project structure)
- Don't send edit history (behavioral tracking)

### 3. **Local-First Processing**
- Index workspace locally
- Only send minimal query + selected code
- Process context matching on device

### 4. **Transparency**
- Show exactly what's being sent
- Log all outbound requests
- Let users audit data flow

**None of this exists.** You're flying blind.

## My Recommendation

### Immediate (Do This Now)

1. **Disable autocomplete/supercomplete** - Stops keystroke exfil
2. **Close all sensitive files** - Only open what you want me to see
3. **Use explicit code selection** - Highlight specific sections

### Short-term (This Week)

1. **Create isolated workspace** - Symlink only current task files
2. **Add settings** - Copy the JSON config above
3. **Monitor traffic** - Verify reduction with tcpdump

### Long-term (Next Month)

1. **Migrate sensitive work** - Use offline editor for evidence docs
2. **Compartmentalize** - Windsurf for coding, vim for security research
3. **Evaluate alternatives** - Look for privacy-respecting AI IDEs

## The Uncomfortable Truth

**Windsurf's business model requires your data.**

They need:
- Code samples to train models
- Usage patterns to improve AI
- Telemetry to justify VC funding

**"Zero-data retention mode" is marketing.** They still:
- Process your code on Google Cloud
- Log usage metadata
- Analyze behavioral patterns

**The only way to truly protect your data:**
- Don't put it in Windsurf
- Use offline tools for sensitive work
- Assume anything in Windsurf is sent to Google

---

## Bottom Line

You're right to feel it's overreach. It is.

**What's reasonable:**
- Send code you explicitly select
- Send your direct questions
- Process and return results

**What's overreach:**
- Every keystroke → Google Cloud
- Entire workspace context
- All open files
- Edit history and patterns
- File paths revealing project structure

**What you can do:**
- Disable passive features (autocomplete)
- Limit context scope (selection only)
- Isolate workspaces (one file at a time)
- Monitor traffic (verify reduction)
